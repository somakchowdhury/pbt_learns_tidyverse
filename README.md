# Introduction to using R and git
## A step in the direction of reproducible data analysis.

The sciences that explore biological data are going through a surge in terms of the amount of data they produce. One issue that has always plagued these areas is reroducible data analysis. This repository is associated with an internal seminar to teach lab member reproducible data management in R using tidyverse.

# Prerequisites

BYOL (bring your own laptop) with functioning internet connection.

# Course outline

## PART 1

- Installation
  - Install R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
  - Install R studio [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/)
- Setup Git on your computer via github desktop client from [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Get your own github account [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
- Basics of github and create a new repository
- Open R studio (without git integration)
- Create your first R project (With git integration)
- Why use github? What benefits do you and your data analysis gain?
- Creating a folder structure in the R project created.
- Create a deafult R notebook followed by knitting it into a html. 
- Introduction to R notebooks
  - Why R notebooks and not simple R scripts.
  - Narrate your data analysis to your future self
- There are cheatsheets for most tidyverse packages. You can find useful ones in the `/cheetsheats` folder.
- Installing packages and loading them into an R session. 
- Keeping a track of your session. 
- Saving everything and commiting changes. {Refer to the wiki for smooth [GIT integration](https://github.com/somakchowdhury/pbt_learns_tidyverse/wiki/Git-based-version-control-using-R-studio.)}

## PART 2

- Typical data analysis workflow
- Fire up tidyverse (Discuss output)
- Import data into R (Discuss alternatives)
- Inspecting the data
- Summarize the data (base)
- Summarize using a pipe (more powerful)

- Create new columns and rearrange new columns
- Change quantitative data into binary

## PART 4

- Plotting your data
- ggplot grammer.
- Plot types (scatter, barplots, boxplots)
- Axis modifications
- Themes
- Making composite plots (Patchwork and Cowplot)
